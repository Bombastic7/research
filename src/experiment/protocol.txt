// Set up //

A conceptual domain:
	Set of problem instances.
	Set of abstraction mappings.
	Set of h/d heuristics.
	

A conceptual algorithm:
	Set of configurations (e.g. wf/wt, caching, top abstraction level)



// Results //

General behaviour stats:
	Expd, gend, dups, reopnd
	Total expd of all abt levels
	open, closed lists
	
	
Specific behaviour stats:
	cache contents
	Resorts


Solution stats:
	Length
	Cost


Results stats:
	Time
	Cost
	Utility


Resources:
	Memory
	Time (cpu/wall)
	



// Problems of interest //

	Domains:
		Tiles = Normal tiles, weighted tiles
		Pancakes = normal pancakes, weight pancakes?
		gridnav
	
	
	Uninformed Tiles, pancakes, ..
	
	Astar Tiles, pancakes, .. /  MD heuristic, PDB

	Speedy 
	
	Bugsy / wf wt

	
	Hastar Tiles, pancakes /  single/all abt levels
	UGSAv2 / wf wt
	



For abt algorithms, pre-run to populate cache - effectively simple search with pdb heuristic.
